By the end of this project, you will be able to:
•	Understand the problem of fraud detection and classify it as a classification problem.
•	Preprocess and clean the data using various techniques.
•	Analyze and visualize data to gain insights.
•	Balance the dataset to address class imbalance.
•	Build and evaluate different machine learning models for fraud detection.
•	Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Architecture
1.	Data Loading: Load the dataset and explore its structure.
